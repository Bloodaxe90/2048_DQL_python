This was my second attempt at implimenting Q-Learning for 2048, 
a while ago i treid to implement it withought neural networks in java as 
i had not yet realised that a tabular aproach only works for small state
action spaces. 

After this failure I started getting into neural networks, I first switched from java
to python as python has a larger comunity and resources for machine learning. Then i set about 
learning pytorch and then implemented my first deep neural net that set about to classify 6 types of images

This was a great success and I learnt alot along the way, after that I set to work on this project and finally 
successfully implemented deep q leanring on 2048

In the inference notebook section you can see the results of my trained 30000 episode agent and that it reached a score of 2048, 
if trained for longer the agent could reach this value more consitently, the base line results where the agent uses a random policy can 
be seen at the bottom of the experiment notebook
